        "scenarioContent":"DIT's grangeMobile app has just been released, and like all lecturers, Dr. O'Neal received an email from the school's administrator asking her to download the app and sign up. She downloads the app and opens it for the first time. She sees the Sign Up page, which prompts her to type in her DIT email address. After clicking OK, she is asked to check her inbox for an email, which will allow the app to verify her email address. She finds the email in her inbox and clicks the link inside it. The link leads her back to the app, where she sees a thank you screen, saying that her DIT email address has been verified, and that all of the details associated with that address in the DIT's systems (name, title, etc.) were automatically added to her account on the app. At this stage, she is also automatically signed in to the app on her phone - by having a session created."
